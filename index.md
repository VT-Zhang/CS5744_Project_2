# Test Scope

This project is for developing an integration and validation testing for the Enhanced Digital Nurse Assistant Care System (ENDA). The test scope of this project will cover the major two categories: integration testing and validation testing.

Integration testing is the next level of software testing after unit testing where individual components are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.

Validation testing is the process of evaluating software during the development phase or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies the specified business requirements.

This project will mainly cover the following testing subjects:

1) Testing for the system basic functionalities, including:
- Registration and login.
- Main user interface.
- Notification.
- Security and data safety.

2) Testing for the main business functionalities, including:
- Communication messaging feature among patients, caregivers, and doctors.
- Patientâ€™s biometric information gathering and warning feature.
- Real-time geolocation tracking feature.

3) Testing for system performance, including:
- Application start up and running speed.
- Fingerprint login scanning accuracy.
- Daily data backup.
- Data streaming performance and speed.
- Software compatibility in various client systems and wearable devices.
