# Validation Test

Following completion of integration testing, validation testing will be performed on the EDNA application to ensure finished software meets the specified requirements. Given that we currently have only a high-level design for the system, below are a series of validation tests that will be performed with traceability back to requirements. As requirements are refined, these test cases should be expanded and made more specific. Additional scenarios will be required, including boundary and negative test cases, as well as specific steps which would be followed for each test case. At this point, it has not been clearly defined which specific features will be available for certain devices (web, mobile, or wearable device) for all functions. However, once those requirements are available, the test cases will be performed using each type of device that supports that function (this corresponds with requirements FR-4, FR-11, and NFR-6).
